# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis
I completed a guided project using Coffee Shop data, utilizing both SQL and Power BI. The project was guided by the 'Data Tutorials' YouTube channel. Throughout the process, I learned how to create interesting DAX queries and visualizations in Power BI, as well as how to use SQL queries to validate results within Power BI reports.
